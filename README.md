This is my ongoing exercism.io work. I like the idea of the site quite a bit -- submit your code to be analyzed and commented on by other programmers.

Getting Set Up

There's documentation about how to get the language environments set up on the help site.

Solving Exercism Problems

The test suites vary a bit from language to language.

Some of the languages use skipped or pending tests in order to simulate the Test-Driven Development (TDD) process.

In these languages, only the first test will be active. Once you write enough code to get that test passing, you'll need to open up the test suite and edit it to remove the skip to activate the next test.

Work through one failing test at a time.

Once you've got the whole test suite passing, take a few minutes to look at the code you have and think about how it could be tweaked to be more readable and expressive.
